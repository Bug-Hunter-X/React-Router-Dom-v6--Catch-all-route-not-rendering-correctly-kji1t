# React Router Dom v6 Catch-all Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with the catch-all route (`*`) in React Router v6.  The expected behavior is that any URL that doesn't match the other defined routes should be handled by the catch-all route and render the `NotFound` component. However, in some scenarios, this doesn't occur. This repo shows the problem and the solution.

## Problem:
The provided code uses React Router v6. When navigating to a URL that does not match any of the defined routes, the `NotFound` component does not render. Instead, the application may render nothing or display an unexpected state.

## Solution:
The issue is often related to incorrect nesting of route elements or other routing configurations.  A possible solution is to ensure the Route components are correctly nested within the Routes component and that the catch-all route is placed as the last route within Routes.
